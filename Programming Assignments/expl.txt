Solving Cell Door puzzle:

There will be some N cells (hard coded as 100).
All the cells have one thief each. One fine morning, the SI calls all the thieves and tells them to go back to their cell as well as multiples of their cell numbers. When a guy visits a cell and finds the door open, he closes it, and if the door is closed, he opens it. all 100 thievs do this operation. All the doors were open initially.
what should be the end result?
(how many cells will be opened and how many closed)

Linked List

This is one algorithm that reorders a linked list as shown below:

Before 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL
After  1->3->2->5->4->7->6->8->NULL

that is, each node will point to its next-next free node and that node points back to its prev node

4.
Magic Square:

This algorithm creates a N * N matrix (whre N is odd no) where in sum of rows, column and diagonals remains the same.
